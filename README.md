This project-of-projects contains tooling, references and prototypes created while developing the 'Solace' framework, using Godot. 

'Solace' is (intended to someday become) a C# based framework for games designed around 'mechanical levels-of-detail'.
For example; simulating the same game world as a turn-based game, a topdown 2d game, and in first-person in 3D; depending on distance to the player(s), adding and removing detail as needed.

While the framework matures, variations on this and similar ideas will be collected here over time.
